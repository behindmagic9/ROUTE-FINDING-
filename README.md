# ROUTE-FINDING-
this project uses the dijkstra as well as bellman ford algorithm , basically to find the shortest path between two vertices .
With including of real time application of dijkstra like the metro route finder here also we have vertex as stations and there edge as distance between those connected stations or vertices , and as like real time there is also the line changing  like from red line to blue line or etc in path 
you can create , update , delete , print the vertices and edges . 
All this is done using c++ and stl libraries .


for use : 

-- step 1- > simple build with g++ command like : 
  > g++ metro.cpp -o a.out

-- step 2 -> ./a.out
